# Collaboration_Network

Build a network of co-occurring cities in publication affiliations. Visualise the network and find interesting relationships. Which are the strongest co-occurrences across countries? Does geography play a role? Use relative optionally log-odds ratios in your analysis. Draw the network on a map.

# Questions

* Are different departments for university considered as different affiliations?
* Is it crucial to have great performance?
* Is the "Place of Publication" relevant? Or should the place be extracted from affiliations?
